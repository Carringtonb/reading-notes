# HTML and CSS

### Chapter 6: Tables
* A table represents information in  grid format
* Tables contain several different parts
    * `<table>`
    * `<thead>`
    * `<tbody>`
    * `<tfoot>`
* Inside these elements the table will contain `<tr>` or table *rows*. Inside the rows will be `<td>` or table *data*.
* Entries can stretch across rows and columns using `<td colspan=">` and `<td rowspan=">`.

# JavaScript and JQUERY

### Chapter 3: Functions, Methods, and Objects
* The *new* keyword and the object constructor create a blank object. `var hotel = new Object();`
* Object constructors can use a function as a **template** for creating objects
* You create *instances* of the object using the constructor function.
* `this.width` is a way to directly reference the width object inside the current function.
* Arrays are a special type of object that hold a related set of key/value pairs, but the key for each value is its index number.
* You can combine arrays and objects to create complex data structures.
* There are three built-in objects
    * Browser Object Model : creates a model of the browser tab or window.
    * Document Object Model : creates a model of the current web page.
    * Global JavaScript Objects : group of individual objects that relate to different parts of the JavaScript Language.
* In order to work with dates, you must create an instance of the **date** object.
