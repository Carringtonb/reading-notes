# HTML and CSS

### Chapter 5: Images
* `<img>` tag will add an image into you code. Within the tag you need to include
    * src - where the browser can find the image.
    * alt - a teext description of the image.
    * title - displays as a tooltip when the user hovers over the image.
    * Width - width of the image.
    * height - height of the image.
* Images used to be able to be aligned through HTML but that feature has been removed for HTML5 and now CSS is to be used.
* Images should be saved in the size you will be using them on the web page and in appropriate format.
* Photograohs are best saved as JPEGs; Illistrations or logos that use flat colors are best saved as GIFs.

### Chapter 11: Color
* The color property affects text color
* Background-color affects background color.
* Colors can be input as RGB values, Hex Codes, or Color Names.
* CSS3 introduces hue, saturation, and lightness as a new way to specify colors.
    * This is written as `background-color: hsl(hue, saturation, lightness, transparency)

### Chapter 12: Text
* Text is commonly split into 3 main types of text:
    * Serif - used for long passages as it is easiest to read.
    * Sans-Serif - Best used if the text is small.
    * Monospace - Commonly used for code because they align nicely.
* Font can be furthered styled with **font-family** and **font-size**.
* font-size can be adjusted using pixels(px), percentages (%), or ems (1.5em).
* You can control the space between lines of text, individual letters, and words. Text can also be aligned to the left, right, center, or justified.
