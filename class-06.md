### Chapter 3: Object Literals

* In an object variables become known as properties.
* In an object functions become known as methods.
* You can access the properties or methods of an object using dot notation.

### Chapter 5: Document object model

* Every element, attribute, and oiece of text in the HTML is represented by its own DOW node.
* Methods that find elements in the DOM tree are called DOM queries.
* `getElementById()` and `querySelector()` can both search an entire document and return individual elements.
* There are two ways to select elements from a node list
    * The item() method
    * Array syntax
* When you have a NodeList, you can loop through each node in the collection and apply the same statements to each.
* To add or remove content from a DOM tree there are two very different approaches:
    * DOM manipulation targets individual nodes in the DOM tree
    * innerHTML is better suited to updating entire fragments
