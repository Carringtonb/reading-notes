# JavaScript and JQUERY

### Chapter 10: Error Handling and Debugging

* The JavaScript interpreter processes one line of code at a time.
* The JavaScript console will tell you when there is a problem with a script, where to look for the problem, and what kind of issue it seems to be.
    * You can also type code directly into the console and will show you a result
* `console.log()` is the primary way to test script and return a result to the console.
* `console.table()` lets you output objects, and arrays that contain other objects or arrays.
* You can create a breakpoint in your code using the **debugger** keyword.
* If you know your code might fail, use *try*. *catch*, and *finally*
    * **Try** - Specify the code you think might throw and exception
    * **Catch** - If the try code block throws an exception, catch steps in with an alternative set of code.
    * **Finally** - The code contents of the finally code block will run either way - whether the try block succeeds or fails.
