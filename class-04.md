# HTML and CSS

### Chapter 4: Links

* Links allow you to move from one web page to another.
* Links are created using the `<a>` tag. Users can click on anything contained within the tag.
* When linking to pages within the same site, you can use a shorthand **relative** URL.
* When linking to email, start the href attribute with *mailto:* then the email address.
* To open a link in a new window, use a **target** tag with the attribute *blank*

### Chapter 15: Layout

* CSS treats each HTML element as if its in its own box.
* If on block-level element sits inside another block-level element then the outer box is know as the **containing** or **parent** element.
* You can specify the positioning scheme of the layout page.
    * Normal flow
    * Relative positioning 
    * Absolute positioning 
    * Fixed Positioning
    * Floting elements
* Different users will be using different screen sizes, which the design needs to account for.
* Web designers often try to create pages of around 960-1000 pixels.
    * Fixed width layouts do not change size as the user changes the size of the browser window.\
    * Liquid layouts do stretch and contract as the browser window is modified.

# JavaScript and JQUERY

### Chapter 3: Functions, Methods, and Objects

* Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task.
* To create a function, you give it a name and then write the statements needed to achieve its task inside the curly braces. This is known as a **function declaration.
* Having declared the function, you can then execute all of the statements between its curly braces with just one line of code. This is known as **calling the function**.
* Some functions need **parameters** to perform their task. The parameters act like variables.
* When you call a function that has parameters, you specify the values it should use in the parentheses that follow its name. The values are called **arguments**, and they can be provided as values or as variables.

### 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

* In pair programming there is a **driver** and **navigator**
    * The driver does all of the actual coding
    * The navigator thinks about the logic, how to best format the code, and look up outside information but does not actually write any code.
