# HTML and CSS

### Chapter 15: Layout

* CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a *block-level* box an *inline box*
    * Block-level elements start on a new line
    * Inline elements flow in between surrounding text
* If one block-level element sits inside another, the out box is known as the *parent*
* CSS has **positioning schemes** that allow you to control the layout of a page
    * Normal flow - every block-level element appears on its own line
    * Relative positioning - Moves an element from the position it would be in normal flow, shifting it to the top, left, right, or bottom.
    * Absolute positioning - This positions an element in relation to its containing element
    * Fixed positioning - Positions the element in relation to the browser window
    * Floating elements - Takes element out of normal flow and poitions it to the far left or right of a containing box.
* Fixed width layouts do not change size as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window.
* Liquid Layouts stretch and contract as the user increases or decreases their browser size.
