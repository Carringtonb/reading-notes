# HTML and CSS

### Chapter 2: Text

* `<sup>` and `<sub>` elements can be used to superscript and subscript
* White space is an option to make code more clean. Adding multiple spaces will show up in code editor but will be rendered as a single space
* Dreamweaver is an option for a HTML editor
* Other elements that can be used include address `<ins>` `<del>` and `<s>`


### Chapter 10: Introducing CSS

* CSS associates style rules with HTML elements
* CSS properties affect how elements are displayed
* You can link to external CSS, the link should use 3 attributes; href, type, and rel.
* You can also use CSS inside an HTML file by utilizing a `<style>` element inside the `<head>` element.
* Value of font-family properties are inherited by child elements.

# JavaScript and JQUERY

### Chapter 2: Basic JavaScript Instructions

* In order to use variables you must create the variable and give it a name. Or you must **declare** the variable.
* Once the variable is declared, you must assign a value to it.
* Variables can be assigned many different values. These include:
    * Numbers
    * Strings
    * Booleans
* When naming Variables
    * Always start with a letter, dollar sign, or underscore.
    * Can contain letters, numbers, dollar sign, or an underscore. Do not include a dash, or a period.
    * Cannot use **keywords** or **reserved** words.
    * All Variables are case senstive
    * Use a descriptive name
    * If your variable is more than one word, use camel case. ex camelCase.
* Arrays are special variables that store a list of data.
* The values in an array are accessed as if in a numbered list, starting at **zero**.
* Expressions evaluate into a single value.

### Chapter 4: Decisions and Loops

* When a script makes a decision you will have sets of code written for both possible outcomes.
* Decision making can be written using *if, then, else* statements.
* You can also compare one value in the script to what you might expect it to be, which will return a Boolean value.
* Logical operators can compare the results of prior comparisons.
* When an **If** statement evaluates to true, the code in the subsequent block will be executed.
* When an **If...Else** statement is evaluated to be true, the first code block will run. When the statement is false, the second code block will run.
* Loops check a condition and run a block of code repeatedly until the condition returns *false*.
* There are 3 common loop types:
    * For loops : runs a code a specific number of times.
    * While loops : The code will continue to loop for as long as the condition is *true*.
    * Do While loops : Do...While loops are similar to While loops, other than they will always run the statement at least once, even if the condition evaluates to *false*.
