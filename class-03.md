### Chapter 3: Lists

* Lists can be either ordered `<ol>` or unordered `<ul>`.
* Items contained inside thoses lists are writtin with `<li>` tags.
* Definition lists `<dl>` can also be used. They will contain a `<dt>` tag for the *term* to be defined, and a `<dd>` tag for the *definition*.
* Lists can also be **nested** within other lists.

### Chapter 13: Boxes

* Box dimensions can be set using height and width. The most common ways to specify size is pixels, percentages, or ems.
* You can also limit sizes with min-width/max-width and min-height/max-height.
* Every box has 3 available properties that can be adjusted to control its appearance
    * Border : Seperates the edge of once box to another
    * Margin : Create a gap betweeen the borders of two adjacent boxes.
    * Padding : Space between the border of a box and any content contained within it.
* Borders can be styled in 3 different ways
    * border-width
    * border-style
    * border-color
* All three of these values can be writtin into one line of code for shorthand styling.
* With CSS3 you can add a border-image, and a box-shadow.
    * The border-image property applies an image to the border of any box.
    * The box-shadow property ass a drop shadow around a box.

### Chapter 4: Decisions and Loops

* Loops check a condition and run a block of code repeatedly until the condition returns *false*.
* There are 3 common loop types:
    * For loops : runs a code a specific number of times.
    * While loops : The code will continue to loop for as long as the condition is *true*.
    * Do While loops : Do...While loops are similar to While loops, other than they will always run the statement at least once, even if the condition evaluates to *false*.
* For loops are typically used to through the items in an array.
* While loops are typically used when you *do not know* how many times you cant a code to run.
